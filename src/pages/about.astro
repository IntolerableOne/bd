      </h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Welcome to the heart of our organisationâ€”our dedicated team. With a remarkable combined experience of over 50 years as midwives in the NHS, our professionals bring not only their vast knowledge but also their deep passion for maternal mental health and family wellbeing to our services. We specialise in supporting those who have experienced birth trauma, pregnancy anxiety, and postnatal mental health challenges.

        Our Commitment to You
      </h3>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Each team member holds a highly respected position within the NHS, reflecting their expertise in both physical and mental healthcare during the perinatal period. Their commitment extends beyond the confines of the hospital, driven by a profound desire to support, educate, and empower mothers and families through trauma-informed care. We understand that birth trauma can have lasting effects on mental health, and we're here to provide the specialised support needed for healing and recovery.

        Why We Care
      </h3>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Understanding the complexities of pregnancy, childbirth trauma, and maternal mental health, our team offers therapeutic support and expert guidance. Whether you're experiencing anxiety during pregnancy, processing a traumatic birth experience, or seeking support for postnatal depression, our specialists are here for you. We combine our midwifery expertise with specialised mental health training to ensure you receive comprehensive, compassionate care throughout your journey of recovery.
        Our approach is grounded in evidence-based practice, focusing on both the psychological and emotional aspects of birth trauma. We recognise that every person's experience is unique, and we tailor our support to meet your individual needs, helping you work through birth-related trauma and anxiety in a safe, supportive environment.
